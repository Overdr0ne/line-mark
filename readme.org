#+TITLE: line-mark: line marking in emacs

* Introduction
Emacs has rect-mark-mode for marking rectangles, much like VIM’s visual block mode, this package just adds line-mark-mode for marking lines, like VIM’s visual line mode.

* Installation
I just use straight+use-package like so:
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package line-mark
    :straight (line-mark :type git
                         :host github
                         :repo "Overdr0ne/line-mark"
                         :branch "main"))
#+end_src

* Usage
Just enable the mode to start marking lines with the ~line-mark-mode~ command.
